<h1>MLMFan Project.</h1>

This project is focused on gathering activity for MLM companies in the following areas:

<ol>
  <li>Twitter (tweets)</li>
  <li>Facebook (public posts)</li>
  <li>Google News (top articles)</li>
  <li>Google Blogs (blog counts)</li>
</ol>
  
The idea is to gather activity and measure over time. Additionally, we run the content through sentiment algorithms that measure "sentiment temperatures" over time.
